# VsEmacs
This project provides a Visual Studio Extension, that provides basic support for Emacs keybindings.   This capability was available in VS2008, but was removed in VS2010 and VS2012.  The source code is derived from the Visual Studio team's Emacs Emulation project, which they have graciously allowed to now be open sourced.
